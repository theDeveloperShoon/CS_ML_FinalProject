# CS_ML_FINALPROJECT
This is the repository for the final project of 
[CS-156 - Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.hofstra.edu/forms/forms_coursedescriptionform.cfm?course=CSC&coursenum=156&term=202109&level=) 
offered at Hofstra University.  

The goal of the project was to get fluent in working with standard tools and techniques of exploratory data analysis by working with a dataset.
The dataset used is the [CommonLit Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlit-evaluate-student-summaries/) on Kaggle.

Within the project we were tasked to create two models and use them to evaluate wording and content of student's summaries 

Model 1 uses cleaned features and linear regression for training

Model 2 uses cleaned features and am algorithm other than logistic regression.
